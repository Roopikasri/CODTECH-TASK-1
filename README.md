**Project** : Mobile App Wireframing in Figma

**Objective** : 
      To create intuitive, user-friendly mobile app wireframes using Figma, aiming to streamline the design process, improve collaboration, and ensure a seamless user experience by visualizing app structures, interactions, and layouts before development. This will facilitate early feedback, iterative refinement, and alignment with client and user expectations.

The project involves creating a wireframe for a mobile food ordering app called "Foody's" using the Figma tool. Below are the key activities and an explanation of the project:

### Key Activities:

1. **Project Planning and Requirement Gathering:**
   - Define the app’s purpose, target audience, and key features.
   - Conduct research on similar food ordering apps to gather ideas and best practices.

2. **Creating Wireframes:**
   - Design the layout for various screens, including the splash screen, homepage, product details, payment, and success screens.
   - Focus on the user experience (UX) to ensure the app is intuitive and easy to navigate.

3. **Prototyping:**
   - Use Figma’s prototyping features to create interactive links between screens.
   - Simulate user flows to test navigation and functionality.

4. **User Testing and Feedback:**
   - Share the prototype with potential users and stakeholders.
   - Gather feedback and make necessary adjustments to improve the app’s usability and design.

5. **Finalizing the Wireframes:**
   - Refine the wireframes based on feedback.
   - Ensure all screens and interactions are polished and ready for the development phase.

### Explanation of the Entire Project:

1. **Splash Screen:**
   - The splash screen introduces users to the app with a welcoming visual (the "Foody's" logo and some appetizing food images).

2. **Homepage:**
   - Displays various burger options available for order.
   - Users can search for items, view categories, and select a product to get more details.

3. **Product Details Screen:**
   - Provides detailed information about a selected burger, including ingredients, price, and an option to order.
   - Users can customize their order by selecting toppings and sides.

4. **Payment Screen:**
   - Users review their order summary, select a payment method (cash or card), and enter payment details.
   - Ensures a seamless checkout process.

5. **Success Screen:**
   - Confirms that the order has been successfully placed.
   - Provides an option for users to go back to the homepage or explore more items.

### Wireframe in Figma:

- The Figma wireframe visually outlines the app's structure and user flow.
- Each screen is linked to create an interactive prototype.
- The user flow starts from the splash screen, moves to the homepage, product details, payment screen, and ends with the success screen.
- Figma’s layers and components ensure the design is organized and easily adjustable.

This project demonstrates a structured approach to designing a user-centric mobile app, leveraging Figma’s powerful design and prototyping tools to create a functional and visually appealing food ordering app.
